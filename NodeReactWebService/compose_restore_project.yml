#	Extending/Chaining 
#
#   Some notes regarding chaining:
#   NOTE 1
#   - Bind mounts don't carry over, you have to specify them again
#   - same counts for network and pretty much all items
#   - So better to use a common compose file and let the other compose files extend from items(like we done see extends: )

networks:
  react_network:                             # Define a network

volumes:
  react-vol:

services:
  webserver-nodejs_22-react:                # Same name as base file!
    extends: 
      file: compose_nodejs_react_cont.yml   # our base compose file, see NOTE 1
      service: webserver-nodejs_22-react    # Same name as base file!
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_RESTORE_Project_Cont

        PRJ_BASE_ARG_REST: ${PRJ_BASE_ARG_REST}

    ports:
        - "${PORT}:${PORT}" # First host second container
    image: eelhart/react-base:latest2       # This name can be used to extend or chain this image.
    environment:
        - PORT=${PORT}  # Pass variable from .env to PORT (1e), this is available in the container(ENV) and in dockerfile, during building after
                        # defining: 'ARG PORT' in the docker file
        
    working_dir: ${PRJ_BASE_ARG_REST}/$PRJ_TARGET_ARG_REST
    command: ["npm", "run", "dev"]         # Development start
#    command: ["npm", "start"]             # Production start
#    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while sleep 1000; do :; done"]  # use this in case of err, let's you get in(CMD)

# End compose file 



# build with:
#
# docker  compose -f compose_restore_project.yml up -d  --remove-orphans --build --force-recreate 
# Use: 'Restore_project.ps1' to execute
