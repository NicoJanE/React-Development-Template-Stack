# What
This is a **Docker Template Stack container for React projects**. It consists of:
- Node.js (required for React)
- React it self
- Project specific Docker compose files, to create and start projects 

You can use this container to start programming in your local environment for development and testing purposes. For the rest of the documentation open [this page](https://nicojane.github.io/React-Development-Template-Stack/)

> ### Preview the markdown files(.md)
>
>To preview the Markdown (MD) files in this project, one of the best solutions is to open these files in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and install the plugin: **Markdown Preview GitHub Styling** (Tested with version 2.04). Other plugins, or plugins for other programs, may not always work correctly with the file links in the documentation. I use the file link syntax supported by GitHub (Jekyll), which is also compatible with the above-mentioned plugin.
