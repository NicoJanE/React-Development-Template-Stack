# What
This is a **Docker Template Stack container (DTS) for React projects**. It consists of:
- Node.js (required for React)
- React it self
- Project-specific Docker Compose files to create and start projects.

You can use this container to begin programming in your local environment for development and testing purposes. For the rest of the documentation, visit the [main documentation page](https://nicojane.github.io/React-Development-Template-Stack/). Other DTS containers can be found [here.](https://nicojane.github.io/Docker-Template-Stacks-Home/)

> ### Preview Markdown Files(.md)
>
>To preview the Markdown (.md) files in this project, one of the best solutions is to open these files in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and install the plugin: **Markdown Preview GitHub Styling** (Tested with version 2.04). Other plugins, or plugins for other programs, may not always work correctly with the file links in the documentation. I use the file link syntax supported by GitHub (Jekyll), which is also compatible with the above-mentioned plugin.
